# AI Game Competition

Learning project for training Scala, Akka and Finch skills

Basic idea is to together develop a game server that hosts games.

Learning goals:
 * (Finch) Use finch to create a rest api
 * (Scala) Write logic for some games in scala
 * (Akka) Implement a scalable system that can run and manage multiple games concurrently
 * (CQRS / Sharding / Persistence) implement event sourcing for the gamestate (incl refactoring of gamestate to suit event sourcing)
 * (Gatling) We need a performance test to finetune the implemented features
